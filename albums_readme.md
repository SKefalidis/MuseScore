Notes:
 - Add albums 'Open recent'
 - Crashes when entering note entry mode with no actual movement selected (the first one has no measures after all...)
 - Toolbar icons don't highlight as they should, but they are functional (mostly)
 - Performance degradation when starting and when changing tab from the combined scores to an individual score (probably the same issue)
