Notes:
 - First album page should have the title like the outside of a book
 - Automatic contents/page_index generation
 - Reorder functions in albummanager.cpp (create a utility tool to do this automatically?)
 - Empty space between 0th movement and 1st
 - Change from album mode to score mode
 - Save in album mode?
 - page view? continuous view?
 - Add album to album
 - Score mode printing
 - Changing tab from the temp score to another should automatically change the mode to score mode (the opposite should happen when changing tab to the temp score tab)
 - Changing from score mode to album-mode should switch the tab to the album score if it exists
 - Albums in the start center?
 - Start center 'Open a Score...' to 'Open File...'?
