Notes:
 - Crash when opening page settings in album-mode
 - Use a variable to store the first real movement and use that for playback/selecting etc
 - Automatic contents/page_index generation
 - Use smart pointers and references
 - Reorder functions in albummanager.cpp (create a utility tool to do this automatically?)
 - Change from album mode to score mode
 - Save in album mode?
 - page view? continuous view?
 - Add album to album
 - Score mode printing
 - Changing tab from the temp score to another should automatically change the mode to score mode (the opposite should happen when changing tab to the temp score tab)
 - Changing from score mode to album-mode should switch the tab to the album score if it exists
 - Albums in the start center?
 - Start center 'Open a Score...' to 'Open File...'?
 - Option to add page break at the end of each score
 - Select elements from different scores in album-mode.
